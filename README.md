# DollarGame
A repository containing the executable jar file and source code for a program simulating the 'Dollar Game' as shown on Numberphile. 

If you just want to check out my program, download the executable DollarGame.jar file. You will need Java installed in order to do this. Source code has also been made available, but I warn you that it is NOT commented.
